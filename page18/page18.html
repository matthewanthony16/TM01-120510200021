            The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed.
        </section>
        <section class="section2">
            The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.

            Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled-pulling, and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.

            The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia.

        <div class="none">
            They were brought to Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually developed and used for sled-dog racing.

            In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia.

            In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds.
